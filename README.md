## Something you must read before using this EFI Template:
1. Please do research your computer (Hardware, Software, PC Model...)
2. Battery status is a BIG ISSUE and I have no idea to fix this. Conclusion below:

| Battery status üîã | Things happened | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Only run with battery | Battery reported correct percentage |
| Low battery (Under 10%) | Battery reported correct percentage and show low battery notification  |
| Battery in charge mode (AC Adapter plugged) | Battery icon reported **"Power Source: Battery"** |
| Battery in charge mode (AC Adapter plugged) and restarted PC | Battery icon still reported **"Power Source: Battery"** |

Note: Battery light lighted up when I plugged AC Adapter

3. If you want to use AirDrop/Hand-off/Continuity function, please replace your wireless card inside your laptop. [Wireless Buyer Guide](https://dortania.github.io/Wireless-Buyers-Guide/)
- ***I haven't included wireless kext in this EFI, so you need to do it manually.***

4. Change BIOS Setting as Dortania's Guide: [BIOS Setting](https://github.com/dortania/oc-laptop-guide-legacy/blob/master/before-you-start/bios-configuration.md)
